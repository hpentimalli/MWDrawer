 MWInvisibleView is a base class for UIViews. You should make your 
 UIView class a subclass of MWInvisibleView to use the features it 
 provides.
 
 The objective of the view is to bypass all gestures that don't hit
 a child view of this view. This is useful for irregular-shaped views
 with images or custom drawn that don't want to create a rectangular
 hit area.
